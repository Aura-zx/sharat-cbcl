#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Introduction =

This code implments a scanning based object detector similar to the scheme adopted in [http://cbcl.mit.edu/projects/cbcl/publications/theses/thesis-bileschi.pdf Bileschi's thesis]. This behaves similarly to histogram of gradient detectors. The detection proceeds at multiple scale. The demo code included contains pre-built car and pedestrian detectors.
